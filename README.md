## Tips

* tried to just used actions data but it wont work properly
* used owner data but based on recorded data that some of them are missing there are few meistakes
* did some refactoring to prevent repetitive code and make it cleaner
* for better strcuture and architecture wanted to use dependency injection but assumed its not requested in assesment and it was more time consuming, some interfaces and DI plugin added is because of that.
* for better understanding the states added colors and markers. pink marker is used for owner
* for faster testing added simulation speed variable. you can change it from manager script.
